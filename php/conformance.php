 * php/conformance.php — does the PHP reference produce THE SAME BYTES as the other four?
 *
 * The golden vectors are this repository's own `vectors/wire_vectors.json` — no vendoring,
 * no pin, because here they are the source. They already hold the JavaScript, Python, Go
 * and Rust references byte for byte. A fifth implementation is only worth shipping if it
 * reproduces them exactly, so this runner is the first gate: no framework, no HTTP, no
 * network — just bytes in, bytes out, compared to the fixture.
 *
 * It deliberately checks the REJECT set too. Producing the right bytes for good input is
 * half a wire contract; refusing the input that cannot be rendered identically across
 * languages is the other half, and it is the half a hand-rolled canonicalizer always
 * skips.

// ------------------------------------------------------------------ the count floor
//
// THE LAST THING THAT CAN GO WRONG SILENTLY. Every check above is reached by walking a file
// this repository does not own, and a suite that runs NOTHING prints CONFORMANT exactly as
// loudly as one that runs everything — `0 passed, 0 failed` is a green verdict. The group
// floors upstream catch a group that shrinks; this catches the whole run collapsing for a
// reason no single group would notice: a vector file that parses to an empty object, an
// early `exit` slipped into a helper, a walk accidentally nested inside a false branch.
//
// Only ONE branch of this file is environment-dependent — the five P-256 owner checks, which
// need OpenSSL — so the floor is stated for both worlds rather than guessed at with a margin.
// Raising it when checks are added is a one-line, deliberate act, and that is the point.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------- what this one does NOT check
// Stated out loud, by name, and asserted to EXIST in the vectors. Go and Rust print theirs for
// the reason this file needs it too: a group nobody loops over is carried in the file, checked
// by nobody, and indistinguishable from a group that passes. Until this implementation moved
// here it declared no skips at all, so four groups were silently uncovered and nothing said so.
